_Paying tribute to a storied browser through the art of haiku._

With Microsoft finally ending support for Internet Explorer, some of our engineers spent a Friday afternoon crafting poetry and reminiscing on the browser‚Äôs 27-year legacy.

## Ice Cube would be proud

> Internet of old<br>
> I cannot render this page<br>
> Goodbye Felicia

‚Äî Jason G., Solutions Architect

## A lesson in hubris and overconfidence

> Exploring the web<br>
> But surfed too close to the sun<br>
> Bugs all the way down

‚Äî Ben Griffin (that's me!), Sr. Software Engineer

## Remember having a dedicated ‚ÄúInternet Explorer PC‚Äù though?

> You thought you were done<br>
> Browserstack said you weren't<br>
> Booting Safari

‚Äî Kurt M., Sr. Software Engineer

## We all know the feeling‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶as we scroll down to the browser support table. ‚ÄúMaybe this time will be different‚Äù we say, but that red rectangle never changes hue.

> Caniuse anything?<br>
> Not while IE 11 needs support<br>
> I won't miss you, friend

‚Äî Harmony H., Principal Software Engineer

> What a feeling to<br>
> ignore the IE column<br>
> when at caniuse

‚Äî Jake R., Software Engineer

## Raise your hand if you‚Äôve ever had a boss or a client who would ONLY use IE6

ü§ö

> Client says it's broke<br>
> Sigh, what browser do they have<br>
> More conditionals

‚Äî Ben Griffin, Sr. Software Engineer

## Death: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time to go‚Äù

IE: ‚ÄúWas I a good browser?‚Äù
Death: ‚ÄúThe very best ‚Ä¶ at downloading other browsers‚Äù

> From the early days<br>
> You were there, loading, crashing<br>
> Just go download Chrome

‚Äî Eric J., Sr. Software Engineer

## A name is a kind of ID, don‚Äôt you think?

> I need this dom node<br>
> getElementById<br>
> Thats not what I need

‚Äî Kurt M., Sr. Software Engineer

## Scene: Friday 4pm

Dev: ‚ÄúFinally got that layout all figured out for the launch on Monday! Let me just check it in IE annnnnd ‚Ä¶ OH GOD NO‚Äù

> Did you check IE?<br>
> No words have stolen more joy<br>
> At the end of day
> ‚Äî Kenji C., Sr. Software Engineer

## This one definitely got the most Keanu-whoa-face emoji reactions

> Lost explorer hums<br>
> Eleventh sired, continues<br>
> hidden, on the edge

‚Äî Eric G., Sr. Software Engineer

## Clear both?

> whole generation<br>
> of new web developers<br>
> what is a clearfix?

‚Äî Zachary C., Lead Software Engineer
