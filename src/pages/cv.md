## Experience

### Technical Lead | Sony

<span id="sony" class="text-sm text-gray-300">March 2024-April 2024</span>

You may not know this, but Sony has a highly successful ISP business in Japan. I was hired to lead the planning, execution, and delivery of front-end software for a new, "premium fiber-to-the-home internet service". Can't say more per the terms of my NDA, but it was really cool! I'm bummed it was so short-lived.

Unfortunately, due to changing strategy at the executive level, this project was cancelled shortly after I started. Still proud of what I was able to accomplish!

- Architected a robust, multi-platform design system using Storybook and Style Dictionary to output a custom Tailwind configuration, increasing engineering efficiency by 50%.
- Created Quality Management Strategy (QMS) in my first two weeks to ensure web application performance and accessibility; presented to Sony leadership.

Believe it or not, I started school with the intention of being a biology major, but got the programming itch when I took a C++ course my sophomore year. At the same time, I discovered I really enjoyed classes on digital art, graphic design and photography.

Eventually, I settled on majoring in Integrated Media, a hybrid major consisting of frontend engineering, UI/UX design, and project management. I intended to earn a minor in computer science, amd completed many high-level math and programming courses towards it, but did not complete the requirements prior to graduating.
